		<p> The Indian Ocean is the 3rd largest ocean, and was first explored around
				<br>
			the 1500s to find a route around Africa. It was used as an important trade route
				<br>
			to trade silk. It has the saltiest and unsaltiest waters in the world and is
				<br>
			responsible for around 40% of oil. It has limited sea life due to the low oxygen
				<br>
			content, but still has interesting animals either way.

		<h3 class="h03"> A Brief History </h3>
		<p> In the 1500s, the Indian Ocean was used to find a route around African and
				<br>
			was already an important silk trade route. It was mostly dominated in the UK in
				<br>
			the early 19th century, but was later conquered by Australia and Indian. Today,
				<br>
			many ports are built in the Indian Ocean and different countries conquer different
				<br>
			parts of the ocean.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3 class="h03"> Animals </h3>
		<p> Unlike other oceans, the Indian Ocean cannot support much marine life. 
				<br>
			The temperature makes it difficult for phytoplankton to grow, which is an
				<br>
			important food source for ecosystems. The ocean also has low oxygen content,
				<br>
			which contributes to the low sea life. Nevertheless, there are still many animals
				<br>
			that live in the ocean, like the African Penguin, the only penguing species in African.
				<br>
			There are also many species of turtles and tortoise, the dugong (a mammal related to
				<br>
			the manatee), and the now extinct dodo bird. There are many different types of sharks and 
				<br>
			whales, crabs, insects, and fish. Pelicans, sea lions, urchins, snails, sponges, and sea slugs.
				<br>
			There are also puffer fish, the second most poisonous creature in the world!

			<li> The water evaporates at a high rate due to the ocean's temperature </li>
			<li> The Indian Ocean is very polluted due to the oil and ship pollution </li>
			<li> Monsoons are a common occurence </li>
			<li> It is estimated the Indian Ocean becomes 20cm wider per year </li>
