		<p>
		The Atlantic Ocean is the world’s 2nd largest ocean, and covers around
			<br>
		one fifths of the world’s total area. The ocean was first mentioned in 450 BC, and
			<br>
		was called the Sea of Atlas. It was also created in the Jurassic Period. It was the
			<br>
		first ocean to be crossed by an airplane and ship. It has the world’s greatest
			<br>
		fishing waters, and also has rich natural gas and oil deposits.

		<h3 class="h03"> Animals and Landscapes </h3>
		<p>
		The Atlantic Ocean is home to many animals and natural landscapes, like
			<br>
		the second largest reef, the Cancun Reef. It also contains the Bermuda Triangle,
			<br>
		a triangular space with many unexplained incidents. In the South Atlantic, there
			<br>
		are the “Roaring Forties”, which refers to the strong winds and waves. There is
			<br>
		an underwater mountain range called the Atlantic Ridge, and is 10 000 miles
			<br>
		south of Iceland.
		</p>
		<p>Like the other oceans, the Atlantic also has many similar animals and
			<br>
		many animals native to the Atlantic. There are many types of whales, sharks,
			<br>
		penguins, fish, sponges, crab, lobster, and squid. There is also the manatee (also
			<br>
		known as the sea cow).  There are many types of sea turtles, which are quickly
			<br>
		becoming extinct. It is also home to the elephant seal, the largest seal on earth.
			<br>
		The fur seal and the frigate bird are 2 more interesting animals that call the
			<br>
		Atlantic Ocean their home.

		<h3 class="h03"> Fun Facts </h3>
		<p>Did you know that the Atlantic Ocean was the first ocean to be fully
			<br>
		crossed by a plane? It was also where Amelia Earhart flyed solo over the ocean
			<br>
		in 1928, making her the first woman to do so. The Atlantic Ocean was also the
			<br>
		place where the Titanic hit an iceberg and sunk in 1928. The Ocean is also 6.5x
			<br>
		the size of the US! The biggest island in the world, Greenland, is also located in
			<br>
		this ocean.
