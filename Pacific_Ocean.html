		<p> The Pacific Ocean is a body of salt water and is the largest and deepest ocean
				<br>
			in the world. It is home to the Mariana Trench, the deepest place in the ocean known
				<br>
			to mankind, along with many different species of animals we haven't even found yet.
				<br>
			It got it's name from an explorer called Ferdinand Magellan in the 16th centurty.
		</p> 
		<br>
		<h3 class="h03"> Animals </h3>
		<p>
			Many different typse of animals make the Pacific Ocean their home.
				<br>
			There’s the Albatross, which is a bird that has the largest wingspan of any bird. 
				<br>
			It’s wingspan can be as long as 11 feet! There are also many different types of 
				<br>
			angelfish, starfish, and sea cucumbers. There are sea urchins that can live up to
				<br>
			200 years, the 3 different species of Rockhopper Penguin, and there’s the manta 
				<br>
			ray that can grow up to 9 meters wide. There are lionfish, many different types of
				<br>
			sharks, eels, lobster, scorpion fish, otters, and sea turtles. Some of the largest
				<br>
			animals of earth live in the Pacific Ocean. There’s the blue whale, the largest
				<br>
			animal on earth. It’s tongue can weigh as much as an elephant! The whale shark is the a gentle giant,
				<br>
			and it can only eat animals the size of a quater. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<h3 class="h03"> The Mariana Trench </h3>
		<p>
			The Mariana Trench is located in the western Pacific East of the
				<br>
			Philippines and is a crescent shaped scar in the Earth’s crust that measures
				<br>
			more than 1500 miles long and 43 miles wide. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The deepest point in the Mariana Trench is called Challengers Deep, and
				<br>
			is so deep that light cannot come and the air pressure can dissolve bones. Only
				<br>
			2 people have made it down to Challengers Deep. They were Jacques Piccard
				<br>
			and Navy Lt. Don Walsh. In 1960, they made it down to Challenger Deep in a
				<br>
			bathyscaphe, a type of deep sea submersible. They were only down there for 20
				<br>
			minutes, and were unable to take any pictures due to the clouds of silt blocking
				<br>
			their path. 
		</p>
		<p>
			Scientist have sent half a dozen machines to explore Challenger Deep,
				<br>
			including Kaiko, which collected over 3000 new species from 1995-2003. Even
				<br>
			though Kaiko has collected so much data, scientists still believe that there are
				<br>
			around 1000 more species in the ocean to uncover.
