		ocean that covers the southern portions of the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian
			<br>
		oceans and their tributary seas surrounding Antarctica. It is the fourth largest
			<br>

		<p>The Southern Ocean has Antarctica, which has 90% of the world’s total
			<br>
		ice. This continent is known as the windiest, driest, and coldest continent in the
			<br>
		world. It is also considered to be a desert, due to the low moisture. The summer
			<br>
		and winter seasons are different then most other parts in the world. The summers
			<br>
		are from October to February while the winters are from March to September.

		The deepest part of this ocean is the South Sandwich Trench that is 23 737 feet
			<br>
		deep.
