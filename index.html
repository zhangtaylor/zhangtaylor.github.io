		<p> The ocean is a vast body of saltwater that covers almost three fourths of
			<br>
		the world. There are 5 main oceans, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the 
			<br>
		Atlantic Ocean, the Arctic Ocean, and the Southern Ocean.

		<p> The Pacific Ocean is the largest and deepest ocean, and is home to
			<br>
		the Mariana Trench, which is the deepest place in the world. It is home to
			<br>
		many different kinds of animals and is located to the east of America to
			<br>
